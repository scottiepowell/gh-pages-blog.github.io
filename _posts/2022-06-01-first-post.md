# Hello!

This is my first blog post in what i hope will be a long line of blog posts.  In the last few years i've gained a deep interest in a home lab setup with a proxmox datacenter running linux VM and containers and self-hosting various open-source services and tools using Docker and Kubernetes.  I'm going to use these blog posts in a few different ways:

1. Check on Learning - i want to validate that progressing as a IT professional, certs, degrees and experience are all great but a written record can validate that you can 'walk the walk' and not just 'talk the talk'. 
2. Historical Documentation - documentation in production is always a bear, at home, it takes a lot of motivation, a lot of times i find myself asking 'wait, how did i do that?'  Google is always ready and willing to help solve problems but with complex issues it's nice to have the code and procedures documented.  
3. Community of Interest - There are many blogs and Youtube channels that have inspired and helped me on this journey of learning, i want to pay it back and if one of my blog posts helps one person that is struggling through a configuration file, then i've met my objective in giving back to the community of iterest
4. Portfolio - I've got more days behind me than in front of me as a U.S. Army Soldier and want to transition to work in the exciting and emerging field of Devops, Cloud and microservices.
