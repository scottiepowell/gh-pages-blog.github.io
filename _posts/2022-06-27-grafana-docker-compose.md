   // Bold is to ** on each side **bold**

   // italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

   // To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

   // Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

[//]: # (If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.)

[//]: # (Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When theyâ€™re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.)

[//]: # (example how to upload a hyperlink to an image ![Tux, the Linux mascot](/assets/images/tux.png))  

[//]: # (If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``).)

[//]: # (create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by)
